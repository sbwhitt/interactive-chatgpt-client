# Simple Interactive ChatGPT Client

## Description

Simple Interactive ChatGPT Client is a Python-based chat application that allows users to chat with an AI chatbot. The chatbot uses GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology to generate conversational responses based on user input.

This chat client uses the OpenAI GPT API to generate responses. It prompts the user to provide input through the command line interface and then sends it to the API. Finally, it returns the response from the API and displays it to the user in the console.
