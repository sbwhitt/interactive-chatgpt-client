# Python CMD line ChatGPT Client

## Description

Command line python client used to chat with OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 model. Saves chat history to build a base of knowledge about the current conversation and prevents rate limit errors by purging oldest messages. Conversations can be saved to be referenced later. System prompts can be modified as well to alter ChatGPT's response behavior. Requires an OpenAI account and api key. Also includes an experimental portion that saves and runs python code generated by ChatGPT.

## Installation

To run, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install openai
   ```

3. Obtain an API key from the OpenAI GPT API website.
4. Add your API key to the `config.py` file by updating the `API_KEY` variable.
5. Run the client by running the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Type message, hit enter, wait on response. Client setup can be modified with these commands: <br />
<b>:q</b>                   -> quit program, saves if saving is enabled <br />
<b>:s</b> or <b>:save</b>   -> enables saving <br />
<b>:d</b> or <b>:debug</b>  -> enables debug information <br />
<b>:r</b> or <b>:run</b>    -> runs last response as a python script if provided (experimental) <br />
<b>:system (prompt)</b>     -> sets given system prompt <br />
